This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
require(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    numericInput("n", "n", 1),
    plotOutput("plot")
    ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$plot <- renderPlot( plot(head(cars, input$n)) )
    },
  options=list(launch.browser = rstudio::viewer)
)
```


### Subheader

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
