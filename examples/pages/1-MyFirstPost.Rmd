This is an example of how a R markdown document can be used to render a page with its own tab in Braceana. Below is a Shiny widget:


```{r echo = FALSE}
exampleWidget()
```

We can also embed the same plot as a static plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
